    <strong>Sales Assistant</strong>
    <p>Help your customers choose the perfect product for their needs. Our sales assistant agents replace in-house sales staff in your virtual platforms.</p>

## Why not Use ChatGPT?

At Promptly, we belive that users are the ones who get to decide how their data is used. We are committed to providing local deployment solutions, and none of your business data is stored on our servers.

We operate based on an <a href="https://bsg.world/glossary/opt-in" target="_blank">opt-in</a> policy, so you can rest assured knowing that your business data is only used once during chatbot model training.
