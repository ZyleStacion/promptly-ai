How to Embed Your Chatbot:

Step 1: Get Your Chatbot ID
- Go to Dashboard
- Find your chatbot
- Click "Get Embed Code"
- Copy the chatbot ID (looks like: chatbot-1234567890)

Step 2: Add to HTML Website
Add these three lines to your HTML file (before closing </body> tag):

```
<!-- Promptly Chatbot Widget -->
<div data-promptly-chatbot-id="YOUR_CHATBOT_ID"></div>
<script>
  window.PROMPTLY_API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';
</script>
<script src="http://localhost:5173/promptly-widget.js"></script>
```

Replace "YOUR_CHATBOT_ID" with your actual chatbot ID from the dashboard.

Step 3: Add to React Website
For React apps, we provide an easy-to-use component:

```jsx
import ChatbotWidget from './components/Chatbot/ChatbotWidget';

export function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <ChatbotWidget chatbotId="YOUR_CHATBOT_ID" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Step 4: Deploy
That's it! Your chatbot will appear in the bottom-right corner.

Embedding Features:

Appearance:
- Floating button with chat icon
- Customizable colors (matches your brand)
- Custom avatar image
- Smooth animations
- Mobile responsive

Interaction:
- Typing indicator shows AI is thinking
- Real-time message streaming
- Conversation history in session
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Auto-scroll to latest messages

Customization Options:

When embedding, you can customize:
1. Colors: Primary color matches your brand
2. Avatar: Custom image for your chatbot
3. Welcome Message: Greet users with custom text
4. Personality: AI tone (friendly, professional, casual, etc.)
5. Response Model: Choose which AI model to use

Example: Custom Implementation
```html
<div data-promptly-chatbot-id="chatbot-1234567890"></div>
<script>
  window.PROMPTLY_API_URL = 'https://your-api.com';
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.promptly-ai.com/widget.js"></script>
```

The chatbot will:
- Load your saved colors automatically
- Display your custom welcome message
- Use your configured AI model
- Apply your personality settings
- Show your avatar image

Troubleshooting:

Q: Chatbot doesn't appear
- Make sure backend API is running
- Verify chatbot ID is correct
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure chatbot status is "active"

Q: Chatbot appears but doesn't respond
- Check backend is running on correct port
- Verify PROMPTLY_API_URL is set correctly

Q: Styling doesn't match my brand
